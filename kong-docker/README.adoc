= kong in docker

// draft script for docker tutorial video

James Gosling promised us Write once run everywhere when he announced Java.
But only docker and containers with Package once run everywhere were able to fulfill this promise.
Hi, I'm Viktor gamov developer advocate at kong.
and today I have, well, kong in a container.

in this video i will explain how to run Kong locally using docker.

â€” intro

docker container are seems to be perfect chosice for distriburing complex software. and docker compose allows to configure collections of containes so we can run and test apps locally.
in this tutorial I will show you how you can use Kong in db-less mode with declarative configuration and Kong with database (i will use Kong with Postgres however Cassandra also supported).
