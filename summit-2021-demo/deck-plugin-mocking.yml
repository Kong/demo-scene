                                          This session will introduce you to Kong’s declarative configuration capabilities and how to use your CI system to lint and apply these configurations in a variety of environments. Test your changes in a staging environment, then apply exactly the same config to production with a click of a button.

                                          Observability is catching on these days as the de-facto way to provide visibility into essential aspects of systems. It would be unwise for you not to leverage it with Kuma service mesh — the place that allows your services to communicate with the rest of the world. However, many observability solutions restrict themselves to the works: simple metric collection that provides them with dashboards. Expecting users to simply sit on their chairs and look at those metrics all day long is an invitation to failure, as we know that one can only do so much when they get tired and bored.

                                          This talk will change the status quo and show how you can work smart by combining the flexibility of Kuma with the power of the Elastic Stack to ingest, store and analyze massive amounts of data. Join to learn how to collect metrics from Kuma via Prometheus, bring these metrics into Elasticsearch using Metricbeat and create machine learning jobs to look for anomalies that can alert you when something interesting happens.
