# Kong Summit 2022 Keynote Demo

There are three parts to this demo

## Service Hub

Focused on the top-down approach, showcasing Service Hub as a service registry. We’ll show off the Christmas lights in the dashboard, build a custom report and show the new export functionality.

All this traffic exists because of API consumers, so let’s show how you can publish API documentation through the Developer Portal and enable Application Registration to allow people to sign up for access to the API in a self-service way.

Finally, reveal that all of this is powered by Kong Gateway 3.0, which we just announced. Showcase new capabilities and highlight some new 3.0 only plugins.

Generate a Kong configuration using inso, then apply it using deck on your local machine.
